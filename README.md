This is an app that helps in managing announcements in a meeting

After signing up, you can create a workspace where you can add contributors. Only contributors would be able to create announcements in the workspace.
If a contributor creates an announcement, the admin will have to approve it before all other contributors can view it
Each announcement has expiry date, after which the announcement will be deleted.

You can delete a workspace when you feel it is no longer useful
